__tritonanalytics__ is the work of the fledging analytics department of [The Triton](http://triton.news) newspaper.

It currently contains:
* A core module that turns exported data from Facebook Analytics into pretty, informative graphs.
* A Flask microserver that, along with displaying the graphs, outputs useful information about The Triton and the work we do.

Keep in mind that this is a work-in-progress. On our TODO list ...
* Integrating post-specific data in the form of Spans on to existing page-specific graphs
* Predicting optimal times to post (time & day)
* Finding an ideal headline format as well as ideal content types
* Identifying topics that beget high numbers of responses, views, and likes
